# Mokasfoci (Bet Game)


This is a React based bet game application you can play with friends. It communicates with a NodeJs server with MongoDb. This repository contains only client app. 

I use the [Black Dashboard React](https://demos.creative-tim.com/black-dashboard-react/#/admin/dashboard) template for application.

## Install client

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/blaskodaniel/mokasfoci.git`.
- npm install
- npm start
